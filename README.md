# GoTMSupport
Functions in the Julia programming language for supporting the writing of TextMate commands for the Go programming language.

Presently it contains support for function and method completion based on [gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode).

These functions depend on the [SimpleParser module](https://github.com/ordovician/SimpleParser.jl) and [PList module](https://github.com/ordovician/PList.jl).
